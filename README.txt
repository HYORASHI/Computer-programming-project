# Carbon Footprint Calculator

This Python program calculates and analyzes carbon footprint based on various factors such as electricity usage, gas consumption, waste generation, and transportation emissions. It provides suggestions for reducing carbon footprint and generates graphical representations of the data.

## Usage

1. **Input Data**: The program prompts the user to input various data points including monthly electricity bill, monthly gas bill, monthly fuel bill, total waste generated per month, recycling/composting percentage, total kilometers traveled per year for business purposes, and average fuel efficiency.

2. **Calculation**: It then calculates the carbon footprint based on the input data using predefined formulas and methods.

3. **Analysis**: The program breaks down the carbon footprint into components such as energy usage, waste, and business travel emissions. It also provides suggestions for reducing carbon footprint based on the calculated values.

4. **Graphical Representation**: Graphs are generated to visually represent the carbon footprint breakdown.

5. **Report Generation**: A detailed report in PDF format is generated summarizing the carbon footprint analysis.

## Functionality

The `CarbonFootprint` class encapsulates the functionality for calculating carbon footprint, generating suggestions, and creating visual representations. Here's an overview of the main methods:

- `calculate_energy_usage()`: Calculates the energy usage based on electricity, gas, and fuel bills.
- `calculate_gas_consumption()`: Calculates gas consumption.
- `calculate_transportation_emissions()`: Calculates transportation emissions based on total kilometers traveled and fuel efficiency.
- `calculate_waste()`: Calculates waste emissions considering recycling percentage.
- `generate_suggestions()`: Generates suggestions for reducing carbon footprint based on various criteria.
- `calculate_optimal_energy_usage()`: Calculates the optimal energy usage based on certain criteria.
- `generate_graphs()`: Generates graphical representations of the carbon footprint breakdown.
- `generate_report()`: Generates a detailed report in PDF format summarizing the carbon footprint analysis.

## Example

To demonstrate the functionality of the program, let's consider an example scenario:

- Monthly electricity bill: $100
- Monthly gas bill: $50
- Monthly fuel bill: $200
- Total waste generated per month: 50 kg
- Recycling/composting percentage: 60%
- Total kilometers traveled per year for business purposes: 5000 km
- Average fuel efficiency: 8 L/100km

After inputting these values into the program, it calculates the carbon footprint breakdown and provides suggestions for reducing carbon footprint. Graphs are generated to visually represent the analysis, and a detailed report is generated in PDF format.
